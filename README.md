# saRa

An R package for a basic course on Statistics in jamovi. Basically based on jmv package, the add-in includes a suite of (univariate and bivariate) 
descriptive methods  for nominal, ordinal, and numeric variables. The add-in also incorporates a module of probability distributions, continuous and discrete, to
be used in a Statistics course. This package is primarily thought and developed to be useable within the jamovi statistical spreadsheet (see <https://www.jamovi.org> for more information).
