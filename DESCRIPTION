Description: An R package for a basic course on Statistics in jamovi.
    Basically based on jmv package, the add-in includes a suite of (univariate and bivariate) 
    descriptive methods  for nominal, ordinal, and numeric variables.
    The add-in also incorporates a module of probability distributions, continuous and discrete, to
    be used in a Statistics course. This package is primarily thought and developed to 
    be useable from the 'jamovi' statistical spreadsheet (see <https://www.jamovi.org> for more
    information).
